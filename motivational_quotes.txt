Believe in yourself and all that you are. Know that there is something inside you that is greater than any obstacle.
Push yourself, because no one else is going to do it for you.
You are stronger than you think. Keep going.
Success doesn't come from what you do occasionally, it comes from what you do consistently.
Every day is a new beginning. Take a deep breath and start again.
Don’t wait for opportunity. Create it.
Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.
Discipline is the bridge between goals and accomplishment.
You don’t have to be perfect to be amazing.
Great things never come from comfort zones.
